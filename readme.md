# Shuffle for Figma
Randomize your grid! This plugin visually reorders your layers.

## How to use

**Just select some layers** **and use it **via Quick Actions or Plugin menu. If you don't like the result, press Cmd/Ctrl+Alt+P a few times.

_If you select only one group, the plugin will shuffle its contents._

## **How it works**

The plugin will store layers' positions, mix them and reassign to selected layers. Shuffle is perfect for grid-aligned items. However, it works with everything.

## **Roadmap**

Shuffle is simple, fast and non-disruptive. It just does its work. If you still have any ideas on how to make it better, leave a comment or contact me.
